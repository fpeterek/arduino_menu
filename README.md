# arduino_menu
Simple menu library for Arduino

I don't have an Arduino device so this program uses iostream. If you want to use this code, implement the io functions 
from io.hpp. This menu only uses standard C libraries, as C++ libraries aren't available on Arduino. I also had to 
implement my own linked list.
